# About

Console app that simulates job scheduler. It sends a job using Azure Service Bus Topic and then listens for execution updates using Azure IoT hub.

## Local runs

Create `appsettings.local.json` with following contents:

```json
{
    "ServiceBus": {
        "Namespace": "<NAMESPACE>.servicebus.windows.net",
        "ConnectionString": "<WHEN NOT USING IDENTITY, USE CONNECTION STRING>",
        "TopicName": "<TOPIC NAME - default is 'jobs'>"
    },
    "Iot": {
        "HubHostName": "<HUB HOST NAME>.azure-devices.net",
        "ManagerUrl": "<MANAGER URL>"
    },
    "ApiKey": "<API KEY generated by deployment>"
}
```

Connection to Service Bus can be done using either `Connection String` or user's identity and `Namespace` setting.
